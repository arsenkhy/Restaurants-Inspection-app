# Restaurant Inspection app
The project is an Android mobile app developed by a team of four students using Android Studio and Java. The app aims to provide users with up-to-date information on Vancouver restaurants' inspections reports, allowing them to search for specific restaurants and apply filters to find relevant information.

The primary goal of the app is to empower users with accurate and timely information about the inspections conducted at various restaurants in Vancouver. By leveraging the Vancouver restaurants' inspections API server, the app fetches the latest inspection reports and presents them in an intuitive and user-friendly manner.
